            <p>Every single day with you has been a beautiful adventure, and I feel
                so lucky to have you by my side. You make everything brighter with 
                your smile, and every moment with you feels like magic. Thank you for 
                being you, for all the love and laughter you bring into my life. I 
                canâ€™t wait to make more memories together. Here's to many more months of happiness and love.
                <br><br>
               I love you more than words can say. ðŸ’•</p>
